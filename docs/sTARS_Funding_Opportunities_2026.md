# sTARS Platform - ACTIONABLE Funding Opportunities

**Updated:** February 3, 2026
**For:** Bueché-Labs LLC
**Focus:** What we qualify for TODAY + What actually PAYS OUT

---

## REALITY CHECK

| Program Type | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| **NASA SBIR/STTR** | ❌ ON HOLD - Congressional reauthorization required |
| **NSF SBIR** | ❌ ON HOLD - Same authorization issue |
| **USDA CEA Loans** | ❌ PAUSED - 90-day freeze due to 43% delinquency |

**Bottom Line:** Most federal small business R&D funding is frozen. Focus on PRIZE COMPETITIONS with guaranteed payouts.

## ACTIVE NOW - CAN ENTER TODAY

### 1. Mars to Table Challenge (ALREADY ENTERED)
**Prize Pool:** $750,000
**Our Status:** Abstract submitted, awaiting approval
**Final Deadline:** August 14, 2026
**Payout:** September 2026

**Action:** Continue current track. This is our primary effort.

### 2. NASA LunaRecycle Challenge - Phase 2
**Prize Pool:** $2,000,000 (Phase 2)
**Registration Deadline:** January 22, 2026 ⚠️ IMMINENT
**Finals:** August 2026
**Payout:** August 2026

**KEY FINDING:** Phase 1 participation is NOT required. Any U.S. team can enter Phase 2.

**Fit Assessment:**
| sTARS Component | LunaRecycle Relevance |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Waste Processing POD | ✅ Direct match - pyrolysis, biogas |
| Nutrient cycling | ✅ Converting waste to resources |
| Closed-loop systems | ✅ Core challenge theme |

**Challenge Focus:** Convert fabrics, plastics, foam, metals into useful lunar resources.

**Requirements:**
- Milestone Round: Preliminary Prototype design (required) + optional Digital Twin
- Final Round: Build and demonstrate hardware at NASA location
- U.S. teams only for prize eligibility

**Realistic Assessment:**
- PRO: Our waste processing concepts align well
- CON: Requires HARDWARE demonstration in August - significant build commitment
- CON: 1,200+ registrations = highly competitive

**Decision Needed:** Can we commit to building demonstration hardware by August 2026?

### USDA Grants
**Status:** CEA loans paused; grant programs may still be active
**Action:** Low priority until USDA clarifies position on CEA funding.

### ARPA-E
**Status:** Budget uncertain (57% cut proposed)
**Action:** Monitor for relevant FOAs but don't count on it.

## SUMMARY: REALISTIC 2026 FUNDING PATH

| Opportunity | Prize/Funding | Can Enter Now? | Hardware Required? | Payout Timeline |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Mars to Table** | $750K pool | ✅ Already in | Simulation + docs | Sep 2026 |
| **LunaRecycle Phase 2** | $2M pool | ✅ Yes (deadline Jan 22) | YES - demo unit | Aug 2026 |
| **NIAC 2027** | $175K | Opens June 2026 | No (study only) | Mar 2027 |

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### This Week
1. **DECIDE on LunaRecycle** - Registration closes January 22. Do we have capacity to build hardware by August?
2. **Continue Mars to Table** - Await abstract approval, prepare for next phase

### This Month
1. **Contact universities** for X-Hab and Human Lander partnership opportunities
2. **Research CASSINI eligibility** for U.S. companies

### Q2 2026
1. **Prepare NIAC proposal** for June submission
2. **Monitor SBIR reauthorization** - have proposals ready

---

## HONEST ASSESSMENT

**Best Near-Term Bet:** Mars to Table (already committed, strong entry)

**Best Additional Opportunity:** LunaRecycle IF we can commit to hardware demo

**Best Long-Term Play:** NIAC - lower competition, study-only, positions us for follow-on funding

**Biggest Gap:** We need SBIR/STTR to reopen for serious R&D funding. Prize competitions are good for credibility but won't fund sustained development.
